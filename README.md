# Convexity v.s. Non-Convexity Problems

This is a brief essay about convexity in machine learning problems. It presents a quick overview of what exactly is a convex problem and a practical comparisson between two models in machine learning to contrast convex v.s. non-convex problems.

The comparisson mentioned above makes use of the $L_2$ loss function considering a linear regression model, and a deep neural network with one hidden layer, sigmoid activation function and linear output.

This repository contains the code used to make the graphs presented as Jupyter notebooks.
